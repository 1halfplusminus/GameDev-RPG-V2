  Description: "Excalibur (/\u025Bk\u02C8sk\xE6l\u026Ab\u0259r/) is the legendary
    sword of King Arthur, sometimes also attributed with magical powers or associated
    with the rightful sovereignty of Britain. It was associated with the Arthurian
    legend very early on. Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone (the proof of Arthur's
    lineage) are in some versions said to be different, though in other incarnations
    they are either the same or at least share their name. In Welsh, it is called
    Caledfwlch; in Cornish, Calesvol (in Modern Cornish: Kalesvolgh); in Breton,
    Kaledvoulc'h; and in Latin, Caliburnus. Several similar swords and other weapons
    also appear in this and other legends.\n\n"
